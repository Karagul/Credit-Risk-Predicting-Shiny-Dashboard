# Credit-Risk-Predicting-Shiny-Dashboard

Open the app.R file in your RStudio. Install all the packages that are listed in the 1st few lines of the app.R file. Now, click on the Run App button without making any changes to the code. You will see a new tab pop up in which will be displayed the Dashboard.

Also, do not change the name of the file. The scipt will only run as long as it is named app.R.
